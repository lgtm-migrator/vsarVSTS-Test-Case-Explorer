## Pivot, filter, edit and analyze usage of test cases ##

The more test cases you have in your project the more challenging it can be to find and work with associated and relevant tests. This extension helps you manage your test cases better.

### Pivot test cases ###
Pivot test cases by different dimensions such as `area path`, `iteration path`, `priority`, `state` and `test plan`.

Using the right-side details pane and `Linked requirements` pane, select a test case to show the associated requirements.
